    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate with a growing
      interest in web development. I am currently learning frontend and
      full-stack web technologies, focusing on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern
      frameworks. I enjoy building clean, responsive user interfaces and
      continuously improving my problem-solving skills through hands-on
      projects. I am motivated to learn, adapt, and start my professional
      journey as a web developer.
